### ABOUT
This is advance word generator with length, gen-limit, pattern, comp-max and breakpoint-word option

I'm not a Python Beginner. The reason I make this because a lot of people(including me) can't think any good name for their variable/project/file/children/dog/cat name. With this Name Generator, it can generate up to million name(if you machine has enough memory).

### HOW IT WORK

It generate word based on the pattern.
